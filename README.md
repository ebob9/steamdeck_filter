steamdeck_filter
-------------------------

A quick shell script to install "super basic filtering" capability for the steamdeck. Best effort, don't bank your kids' future on this.


Steam Deck's "Family" supervision is great - except it allows my kids to watch Youtube unrestricted by going to "community" pages. This mod is meant to make that a bit more dificult by simply DNS blocking Youtube at the system level. They don't have the passcodes to log in, so it's effective for that situation only.
